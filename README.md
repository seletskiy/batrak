First create configuration file in you home directory

```
vim ~/.batrakrc
```

and fill it with the following parameters

```toml
username = "JIRA_USERNAME"
password = "JIRA_PASSWORD"
jira_api_url = "http://JIRA.DOMAIN/rest/api/2"
project_name = "JIRA_PROJECT_NAME"
```

also, if you know filter ID in JIRA you may define it in config.

```
filter_id = JIRA_FILTER_ID
```

You may manually ordering print issues by status.
Just add following lines in you config with status and order description
```toml
[workflow]
  [[workflow.stage]]
    name = "In progress"
    order = 1
    kanban_order = 2
  [[workflow.stage]]
    name = "Analysis"
    order = 2
    kanban_order = 1
```

You can specify workflow configuration in separated file and then specify path
to this file using `--workflow <path>` flag. Workflow configuration in this
case will be without `workflow.` prefix:

```toml
[[stage]]
    name = "In progress"
    order = 1
    kanban_order = 2
[[stage]]
    name = "Analysis"
    order = 2
    kanban_order = 1
```

Batrak support hooks (pre_start, post_start, pre_stop, post_stop)
Hook - it just binary file or script that takes two string arguments:
* Jira issue Key - "TEST-100"
* Credential for connecting to JIRA API - "JIRA_USERNAME\x8EJIRA_PASSWORD\x8EJIRA_API_URL"

If you write you own hook, who does something with your issue, and you want use it after issue was stopped, 
add this lines in your config

```
[hooks]
post_stop = ["hook_name"]
```
